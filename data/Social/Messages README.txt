Messages Data Export

This portion of your data export includes all of your conversation history from within Fitbit.

Each file included represents one conversation, and is the list of messages within that conversation.

Each conversation is grouped by conversation type.

Each row represents one message, like so:
----------

    conversation_id     - the id of the conversation
    message_id          - the id of the message
    content             - the messages text
    sent_by             - the user who sent the message
    sent_by_id          - the id of the user who sent the message
    timestamp           - the time that the message was sent
